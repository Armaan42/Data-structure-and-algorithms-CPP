/*
Find a "peak" element in an array. A peak element is one that is not smaller than its neighbors. For an array nums, nums[i] is a peak if nums[i] >= nums[i-1] and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]. For corner elements, you only need to consider one neighbor. Return the index of any peak element in O(log n) time.
